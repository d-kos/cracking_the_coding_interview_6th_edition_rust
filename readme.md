## CTCI 6th in Rust

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/d-kos/cracking_the_coding_interview_6th_edition_rust.svg?token=sNjGsNiesGj4Fh2vAs2J&branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/d-kos/cracking_the_coding_interview_6th_edition_rust)

Solutions to problems from the 6th edition of [Cracking the Coding Interview](http://www.crackingthecodinginterview.com/) written in Rust.  
There is no better way to learn Rust smart pointers than writing data structures from scratch.  
Everything is written in [safe Rust](https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/meet-safe-and-unsafe.html).  

#### Status

WIP at chapter 5 currently.  
Not all solutions are optimal,  I've tried to reuse as much code as possible so chapters 2 - 5 including Linked List, Graphs, BT & BST...
are solved mostly by extending data structures with traits or in the ds implementation.  
Most if not all of data structure internals is exposed publicly for simplicity.
